# extra chapters

sometimes i find that the textbook i'm using doesn't have the coverage of the material i want to go over in class, so i write some additional chapters.
here are the chapters i have so far.

<a id=cpp23>
## extra C++23 chapters

<a id="c4cpp"/>>
## extra C for C++ programmers chapter.

this comes at the end of the C++ class and my favorite C text `The C Programming Language` is a little overkill

- [C for C++ Programmers](c4c++.pdf) the chapters
- [C for C++ Programmers Answers](c4c++-answers.pdf) the answers to exercises from in the chapters. (don't read until you've come up with your own answers ;) )
