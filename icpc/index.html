    <p>the <a href="https://icpc.global/">ICPC</a> programming competition is a very old world-wide programming competition for undergraduates. it was around when i went to school! i was on our school's programming team. (yay miami university!) we didn't do that great, but it was a fun experience, and i learned a lot of programming techniques.</p>

    <p>we have competed for years now, after a long break. check out the <a href="2025/">2025 teams</a>, <a href="2022/">2022 teams</a>, <a href="2021/">2021 teams</a>, <a href="2020/">2020 teams</a> and the <a href="2019/">2019 teams</a>. we also have yearly local contests <a href="../contest/">2025 local contest</a>.</p>
