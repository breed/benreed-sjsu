we sent 5 teams to the 2020 ICPC programming competition. because of COVID, the contest actually happened on march 6th. it was our second year participating! this year, we participated in both division 1 and division 2 in the pacific northwest region. (the hardest region in north america!) the competition lasted for 5 hours. because we were all remote, these are the best competition team photos we could do:
