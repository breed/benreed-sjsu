i want the masters and senior students i work with to have productive projects that contribute to the community, give them good practical experience, and highlight the skills they have developed.
for that reason, if you want to work with me:

1. **meet with me at least the semester before you start 195A or 295A!** i want to make sure that you understand the project you are going to take on and have the background to do it. ideally, you would start working in my research group before you start 195A or 295A.
2. make sure your project is aligned with my research areas. see [http://www.sjsu.edu/people/ben.reed/systems-group/](systems-group/) for some of my projects.
3. i do meet regularly with my research groups and expect consistent effort on projects, so make sure you are willing to do that.

if all that sounds good to you please drop by my office hours or the lab to talk.
